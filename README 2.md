# Travel Buddy
The purpose of this project was to build a MERN + GraphQL stack one-stop shop application for travel enthusiasts (similar to Tripadvisor). The original intent was to let users search for destinations, search/book flights, and add cities & attractions into a 'saved places' list. In addition, users could sign up and post about their future travel plans, write about their travel experiences, and even ask for travel tips from other users - which is a working functionality in the app in its current state.

## Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your operating system
2. Install ***all*** of the dependencies listed above via command-line in terminal by entering `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file
4. Enter a secret as a `SECRET` variable in the `.env` file
5. Retrieve an API key from [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/), and enable the Maps JavaScript API. Then enter the API key for the variable `REACT_APP_GOOGLEMAPS_API_KEY`.
6. To compile the development build of the website, execute the following command in the root:
```
npm run develop
```
7. Compile a production build when the website is complete by running:
```
npm run build
```

## Usage
Enter `npm run develop` at the root directory in terminal. This will start up the React app and initialize the back-end at the same time. The application will open automatically in your browser. Navigating through the application is fairly straight-forward with the navigation links at the top of the screen. Happy travels!
